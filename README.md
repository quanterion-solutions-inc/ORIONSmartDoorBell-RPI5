## That will...
- Display streaming video in a Web App when the doorbell button is pressed, or when motion is detected
- Play a customizable doorbell chime
- Provide an intercom system to allow remote communication between the App and the person at the door
- Use Advanced Artificial Intelligence to describe ”who” or “what” is at the door
- Ensure secure/encrypted communication between theDoorbell and the Web App.
- Whatever else you can make it do…
## Using...
- Raspberry Pi 5 running Debian-based Raspberry PI OS (Linux) 
- Electronic components that implement the doorbell device 
- OpenAI GPT-4o model
- Network (Cyber) security protocols and tools
- The Software you develop to make it all work

# Goals...
## Learn, Get Inspired, and Get Involved!
